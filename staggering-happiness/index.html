                <p>It's no secret that being happy adds value and meaning to your life (and vice versa), but according to recent research the two aren't always one and the same. Research published in the Journal of Positive Psychology suggests that while there's often some overlap, happiness is directly tied with getting what we seek -- whether that's money, relationships or other circumstances -- where meaningfulness deals more with giving back and effort.Researchers also found that living a meaningful life includes more stress and challenges and involves looking at the past, present and future. Meanwhile, those seeking happiness mainly focus on the present moment.</p>

				<h1>FAQ</h1>
            </div>
				
			<h2 class="faq-content">
     		 Q: Why bother to study happiness at all?
     		</h2>
			
     		<p class = "answer">
     		</br>Because in fact we all desire happiness!  
     		Long ago Aristotle argued that while we always desire happiness as an end itself, 
     		we desire other things as a means towards obtaining happiness.  
     		This makes happiness the “chief end” or ultimate purpose of human life.
     		</p>
     		
     		<h2 class="faq-content">
     		 Q: When did happiness become an object of scientific investigation?
     		</h2>
     		
     		<p class = "answer">    		
            </br>Only very recently.  Most the 20th Century psychologists adhered to 
     		a “disease model” of the mind, and they focused on what makes human beings unhealthy 
     		(e.g., studies on schizophrenia, obsession, neurosis, etc).  True enough, there were a 
     		few people calling for a change: Abraham Maslow’s “self-actualization” and Carl Rogers’ 
     		“full functioning” were concepts that turned attention to qualities of optimal experience,
     		 what human beings can become if they reached their full potential.   But it is safe to say
     		 that this “humanistic psychology” was a voice calling from the fringe of the field, and also had
     		 little empirical data to support it.  This has all changed in the past thirty years, largely due 
     		 to the tireless efforts of psychologists like Martin Seligman, Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi, and Ed Diener.
     		 The crescendo of this new movement was reached in 1998 when Seligman delivered his presidential address to the American
     		 Psychological Association.  Seligman called for his colleagues to free themselves from their problem-based
     		  focus and “go back to the roots” of psychology, which is not primarily about curing human illness, but identifying and 
     		  realizing what makes for an excellent human life.
     		</p>
     		
     		<h2 class="faq-content">
			     Q: What about the relation of wealth to happiness: can money buy you happiness?
     		</h2>
			
     		<p class = "answer">
            </br>No.  Most blue-collar working people are as happy as rich people, and teenagers from working class families describe 
     		themselves as happier than teenagers from affluent families.  Surveys in many countries conducted over decades indicate
     		that, on average, reported global judgments of life satisfaction or happiness have not changed much over the last four
     		decades, in spite of large increases in real income per capita. This remains true even though trillions of dollars has
     		been spent in the last few decades on drugs designed to combat depression and stress (in 2007 alone $287 billion was spent on prescription drugs).  
     		It is safe to say that the research has confirmed the old saw that “money does not buy happiness.”  Indeed, it has even been found that people who win the lottery, while they enjoy a temporary boost, ultimately revert back to their set level of happiness after a short period of time.   Evidently, if one wants to improve one’s happiness, it will not be found in making more money, buying a bigger house, winning the lottery, improving your looks or even changing location (it has been found that people who relocate do not find happiness either).
     		</p>
			
			<h2 class="faq-content">
			     Q:  Well if these things can’t improve happiness, what can?
     		</h2>
			
     		<p class = "answer">
     		</br>As philosophers have warned us time and time again going back 
     		to Socrates and Confucius, if happiness is to be found it must come from within.  
     		Indeed, there are many studies that have confirmed that happiness levels can be increased 
     		through voluntary activities engaged in over long periods of time.   One of the most significant activities that has an effect on long-term happiness is acts of kindness: people who become habituated into helping others with no thought of reward show marked gains in happiness over time.  Once again we see some confirmation of ancient wisdom, in this case that old beatitude “Happy are those who hunger and thirst with righteousness, for they will be satisfied.” (Matthew 5:7)  Another interesting area of research is that on gratitude: grateful people have been shown to have greater levels of positive affect, a greater sense of belonging, and lower levels of depression and stress.  One particular study was especially interesting: Seligman and colleagues asked visitors to their website to write a letter to a person that they felt they had never properly thanked for a past kindness. These people were then asked to deliver this letter in person to their benefactor.  It turned out that these people experienced a substantial increase in happiness compared to people who only wrote about their early memories.   Philosophers have often referred to this as “the paradox of happiness:” if you want to be happy, don’t think of your own happiness, think of the happiness of others.

            <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.</p>
            
            <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
            <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p>
            
            <h3>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h3>
            <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
            <p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
            <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes.</p>
            
            <h3>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h3>
            <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
            
            <h3>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h3>
            <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>
            
            <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
            <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
            <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
            
            <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
            <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
            
            <h3>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h3>
            <p>We will notify you via email and in-site notification within 1 business day.</p>
            <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
            
            <h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>
            <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
            
            <h3>We collect your email address in order to send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</h3>
    
            <h3>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
                <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
                <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
                <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
